# A Self-Calibrating End-to-End Pipeline for Real-Time Speed Estimation for Traffic Monitoring

### This repository provides an easy way of estimating the speed of traffic leveraging uncalibrated video footage.

## Structure
The project is split into multiple modules, each handling a part of the total pipeline.

<img src="images/pipeline.png"  width="40%">

The different modules of this project can be found inside the folder *speed_estimation/modules*
Currently, there are:

| Module Name                     | Folder                   | Description                                                                                                                                                           |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Depth map                       | modules/depth_map        | Generates a depth map for a provided frame, using a customized version of the [Pixelformer](https://github.com/ashutosh1807/PixelFormer).                             |
| Evaluation                      | modules/evaluation       | Compares videos with the provided ground truth on the BrnoCompSpeed Dataset.                                                                                          |
| Car Tracking                    | modules/object_detection | Detecting cars in a video frame by with a YOLOv4 model. If you want to use your own model, place it in the folder `modules/object_detection/custom_object_detection`. |
| Calibration                     | modules/scaling_factor   | Automatically calibrates the pipeline at start and derives a scaling factor.                                                                                          |
| Shake Detection                 | modules/shake_detection  | Detects if the camera perspective changed. If so a recalibration is required.                                                                                         |
| Stream-Conversion & Downsampler | modules/streaming        | Reads a stream, caps it to 30 FPS and provides the frames.                                                                                                            |

## Setup

Running the code can be done in two ways:

1. Locally
2. Docker (with and without CUDA support)

### Local Setup

0. (Have python virtual environments set up, e.g. through `conda`)
1. Install requirements from `environment.yml` or if you are using macOS from `environment_mac.yml`:\
`conda env create -f environment.yml`
2. `conda activate farsec`
3. Install [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) for your machine.

```sh
# Mac
> brew install ffmpeg
# Ubuntu / Debian
> sudo apt install ffmpeg (if it does not work run this command: sudo apt-get clean ; sudo apt-get update ; sudo apt-get check ; sudo apt-get purge ffmpeg* -y ; sudo apt-get autoremove -y ; sudo apt-get -f satisfy ffmpeg -y)
```
4. `cd scripts/`
5. Run `/bin/bash customize_pixelformer.sh`. With this command the [Pixelformer](https://github.com/ashutosh1807/PixelFormer) repository will be cloned into the correct folder hierarchy. It additionally customizes the code, so that it fits into our pipeline.
6. If you want to clean up the customization scripts used in step 5, run `/bin/bash cleanup.sh`. This step is not mandatory. 
7. Download the weights for the depth map from
   here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s7AdfwrV_6-svzfntBJih011u2IGkjf4/view?usp=share_link
8. Place the weights in that folder: `speed_estimation/modules/depth_map/PixelFormer/pretrained`
9. Download the YoloV4 weights from here: https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/releases/download/darknet_yolo_v3_optimal/yolov4.weights
10. Place the weights in that folder: `speed_estimation/model_weights/`
11. Update the paths in `speed_estimation/paths.py` (detailed information in Section Configuration).
12. Activate the pre-commit hook: `pre-commit install` (the hook will then be installed in this directory `.git/hooks/pre-commit`)

### Docker Setup

#### Without CUDA
0. (Have `docker` installed)
1. Go through steps 4. - 11. from the [local setup](#local-setup), to prepare the repository which will later be mounted into the docker container.
2. Go to `docker` directory in a terminal.
3. `docker build -t farsec:latest .`
4. Start the docker container with following command: (note that in this case the paths configured in speed_estimation/paths.py will be considered. If you want you can also pass the correct paths as arguments, as described [here](#run))

```
docker run --rm -v $PATH_TO_REPO:/storage -v \
-t farsec:latest python3 /storage/speed_estimation/speed_estimation.py
```

#### With CUDA
**Note: We used this setup on an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 with Cuda 11.4. It can happen that this setup needs some modifications to fit your individual setup.**

0. (Have `docker` installed)
1. Go through steps 4. - 11. from the [local setup](#local-setup), to prepare the repository which will later be mounted into the docker container.
2. Go to `docker/cuda` directory in a terminal.
3. Run `docker build .` Assign a tag, if you like.
4. Run the docker container with the following command:

```
docker run --rm \
        --gpus '"device=0"' -v $PATH_TO_REPO:/storage -v $PATH_TO_VIDEO_ROOT_FOLDER:/scratch2 \
        -t cv-cuda python3 /storage/speed_estimation/speed_estimation.py \
        "$PATH_TO_SESSION_DIRECTORY" "$PATH_TO_VIDEO_FILE_IN_DOCKER"
```

Replace `$PATH_TO_REPO`, `$PATH_TO_VIDEO_ROOT_FOLDER, "$PATH_TO_SESSION_DIRECTORY"` and `$PATH_TO_VIDEO_FILE_IN_DOCKER` with the paths on your
machine.

**Note: This repository has a default configuration (`speed_estimation/config.ini`) that can be adjusted if necessary (see Section [Configuration](#configuration)).**

The default configuration in `speed_estimation/config.ini` matches the demo video we have linked in Section [Dataset](#dataset). If you are using the BrnoCompSpeed dataset and wanna reproduce our results, you can use the configuration we have used:

```
[main]
fps = 50
custom_object_detection = False
sliding_window_sec = 60

[calibration]
num_tracked_cars = 400
num_gt_events = 50

[tracker]
car_class_id = 2
; Maximum distance for that bounding boxes are accepted (from the closest bounding box)
max_match_distance = 50
object_detection_min_confidence_score = 0.1

[analyzer]
speed_limit = 80
avg_frame_count = 35.142857142857146

[device]
use_cpu = 0
```


Additionally, the `speed_estimation/paths.py` can be adjusted.

## Dataset

As a test dataset, we provide you a short video which can be downloaded [here](https://www.pexels.com/video/aerial-view-of-flow-of-traffic-in-the-highway-3078508/), rename it to `video.mp4` and placed in this directory: `datasets/`. This video is just to validate if the pipeline starts to run and your setup works fine.
It is too short for a sophisticated calibration, so do not wonder if the speed estimates are not overly correct.

As a sophisticated dataset, we utilized the Brno CompSpeed dataset, which provides ground truth information for each car. We used this dataset to evaluate the performance of our pipeline.
Please contact {isochor,herout,ijuranek}@fit.vutbr.cz (see https://github.com/JakubSochor/BrnoCompSpeed) to receive a download link for the dataset.

**The pipline does also work with other videos and datasets, what means that you do not necessarily use the Brno CompSpeed dataset, but your own ones.**

1. Store the video(s) in `datasets`. If you store them somewhere else adjust the `SESSION_PATH` and `VIDEO_NAME` in `speed_estimation/paths.py` accordingly

## Run

The path to the video should be given to `speed_estimation/speed_estimation.py` as argument.
If you do not give the path as argument adjust the `speed_estimation/paths.py` accordingly.
To get a visual output of the detections and tracking in the frame, set `enable_visual`.

1. `cd speed_estimation`
2. ```python speed_estimation.py --session_path_local /path/to/session --path_to_video /path/to/video.mp4``` 
or `python speed_estimation.py` (this will use the default paths configured).
The visual output will be enabled when running the following command `python speed_estimation.py --session_path_local /path/to/session --path_to_video /path/to/video.mp4 --enable_visual true`

During speed analysis the pipline will update the picture `speed_estimation/frames_detected/frame_after_detection`, which gives you visual impression of what cars are detected and tracked even if you run the pipeline on a headless system.

## Evaluation

To evaluate the speed estimates, the repository holds the module `speed_estimation/modules/evaluation`.
This module is called as soon as the video footage is analyzed. Please note that the evaluation module was build on top of the BrnoCompSpeed dataset.
If you are not using this dataset, the evaluation module will not be applicable to you in a plug and play manner.
Feel free to extend the module to fit your requirements.
